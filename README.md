# EngineMKR
This simple tool allows to create plausible torque curves and turbo data starting  from technical specs like displacement, bore on stroke ratio, timing and engine map. It prints the results directly in the prompt, to see what they look like copy and paste them in https://acstuff.ru/u/torque-helper/ (the first data set you get has to be put into power.lut deleting anything there is first, the stuff relative to the turbo has to be added into engine.ini without deleting anything but the data of a previous turbo if present. REMEMBER TO ADJUST THE LIMITER IN engine.ini)
